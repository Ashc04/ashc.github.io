                <p>This is my third favorite video because I love Markiplier! He's a really funny guy and has some great videos on his channel. <br> He does a ton of video game walkthroughs, which, may I add, are hilarious. <br> Markiplier has been around YouTube for a very long time, and at one point, he was one of the most popular creators. <br> I really like his "review" videos, but for some reason he stems them around the sour patch kids brand, and apparently, they make cereal and ice cream! <br>Markiplier has managed to find a bunch of random foods and provide some good reviews for them.</p>
