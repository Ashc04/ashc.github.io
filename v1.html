                <p>This video made number 2 on my list of favorites because I thought it was really cool to watch! <br> As a pilot myself, I really love airplanes and everything aviation related. This video is really awesome to watch and it shows the <br> ability of our military's aircraft. It's a very inspiring video for me, as I aim to join the Air Force Reserves after I graduate<br> college. I often watch videos such as this to gain motivation and remember what i'm working towards! This <br> YouTube channel has a lot of interesting videos pertaining to life in the U.S. Military, so if you're interested, check it out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcyq283he07B7_KUX07mmtA">here</a> <br>  </p>
